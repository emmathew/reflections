When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It is great for sharing the project with others or if there are more than one person working on the project. It is also good to have  backup of the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I don't want to have my local repo updating in the background without my knowledge.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is used for cloning a project within git hub. clone is used for making a local copy of a project. branches are alias for commits

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This will help to merge between the remote branch the local branch locally without having active connection to remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Withwout git or github to collaborate it will be a mess. I would have to share the location or the copy of the code. Only thing that could be easier is that I don't have to rememeber any of the git process or commands to be followed.
